My solutions for the [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).

###Disclaimer

I will only commit my solutions if they are correct. If you stumbled upon this
repository while struggling to find a solution to a particular problem, consider
not looking at my code.

The fun part of solving the problems is the process of researching the
mathematical background of those problems. You won't find satisfaction or
enjoyment by simply copying answers or solutions and submitting those.

If a solution isn't immediately apparent when reading a problem, then perhaps 
you have not grasped the underlying concepts sufficiently. Open up the most
relevant Wikipedia article and read until you are able to formulate an answer.

Good luck!
